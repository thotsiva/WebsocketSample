Hi Sibish,
Good afternoon.

ELF Migration – Proposed Approach:
We had a call with the ELF Team today and walked them through the proposed solution. They are aligned with the approach we suggested. The team mentioned they would review the changes we’ve implemented and will reach out if they need any further information.

Python Solution for ELF Migration:
I have made a few updates to the AMEX Logger as per the earlier discussions. These changes still need to be deployed and validated. Once we are generating a consistent set of logs, I will schedule a session with the relevant developers to walk through the updated approach. (Some engineers were already briefed earlier, and they had requested these modifications to the logger.) I will also document the solution and share it with the ELF Team accordingly.

H1B Transfer Petition:
USCIS has approved my H1B transfer petition today. I’ve requested Manny to consider an earlier joining date (he mentioned August 11, but I’ve requested on or before August 4). I wanted to formally request your support for the same. Once the joining date is confirmed, I’ll notify my current employer of my resignation and proceed with travel arrangements to India.

I would appreciate it if you could confirm this at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,
